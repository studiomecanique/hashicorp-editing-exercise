# hashicorp-editing-exercise
Editing exercise for HashiCorp

This is my edit of the draft getting started guide. I included a bit of extra information about what the commands do, for example, although this information could always be stripped out and left in a section that provides supplemental information on using the commands or the expected configuration on the local machine to which they should be applied.

I did have a question about the statement in the draft that the exercise uses the AWS provider. Perhaps it was because of my lack of familiarity with Terraform but I did not recognize that from the provider block that was included in the configuration code. I would have a question about that for the SME. For now, however, I continued to work with the reference to an AWS provider while also enumerating the Docker provider that was specified in code.

Nice to learn a bit more about IaC.
